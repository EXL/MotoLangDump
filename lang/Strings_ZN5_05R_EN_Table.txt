For example, press 2-2-2 to get the letter 'c'. With Word Text Mode, press each key only once and the phone predicts the word. For example, press 2-2-8 to get the word 'act'. Sometimes in Word Text Mode a down arrow will appear. This means there are other words to cycle through if the predicted word is not the intended one. For example, pressing 2-2-8 can also lead to the word 'cat' (note that when a word is underlined, it is still being created and when the word is completed, it will no longer be underlined). To cycle through a list of alternative words, press the down or up navigation keys. Finally, use the following keys for other inputs:
